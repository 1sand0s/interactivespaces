Building Interactive Spaces requires the following dependencies:

The Android SDK

The RXTX Java serial communications library.
from http://rxtx.qbang.org

The Bluecove Bluetooth Library
from http://bluecove.org/

Jython
from http://jython.org/

JSR-80
from http://sourceforge.net/projects/javax-usb/

usb4java
from http://kayahr.github.io/usb4java/

OpenCV
from http://opencv.org

Create a file in the root folder of the Interactive Spaces project called
gradle.properties.

This file should contain the following properties. Each of the properties
ending in .home say where you have a package installed. The examples
below give a fake place where each software package is installed, you will
change these to match where you installed the particular packages.

android.sdk.home = /home/you/software/android/android-sdk-linux_86
rxtx.home = /usr/share/java/RXTXcomm.jar
bluecove.home = /home/you/software/bluecove/bluecove-2.1.0.jar
jython.home = /home/you/software/jython/jython2.5.2
jsr80.home = /home/you/software/jsr80/jsr80-1.0.0.jar
usb4java.home = /home/you/software/usb4java/usb4java-1.0.0.jar
opencv.home = /home/you/software/opencv/release

The Android controller is built for a given minimum version of Android.
The following example shows building the Android controller for Ice Cream
Sandwich.

android.platform = android-16

Install ROS on your computer. Install from www.ros.org. I usually install the
desktop full version, though there may be a smaller version that will work.

Place your interactivespaces repository on the ROS package path.

The Interactive Spaces documentation is built with the Python documentation 
system Sphinx. It uses Latex for building the PDF documentation. On Linux, make
sure you install texlive, textlive-latex-extra, and texlive-fonts-*. You also
need pygments.

Building an Image:

gradle -PimageHome=path createImage

where path is the root folder which will receive the image.

The image will contain a master, controller, and workbench.
