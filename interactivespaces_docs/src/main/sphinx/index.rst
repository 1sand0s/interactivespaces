Interactive Spaces
============

Interactive Spaces are physical spaces which can interact with their occupants in some way. To do 
this, the spaces will contain two types of objects. Sensors, things like push buttons, keyboards, 
pressure sensors, and cameras to be able to tell something about the space’s occupants, and what 
they are doing. Effectors can then respond in some way. Examples of effectors could be anything 
from putting something on a video screen, moving a physical arm, or turning on a light.

The Interactive Spaces framework is both a collection of libraries for writing activities in 
the physical space and a runtime environment which will run these activities and allow you to 
control them. The system has been designed so that you can start with relatively simple 
activities where Interactive Spaces is doing most of the work, but can get as advanced as you 
want. Hopefully peeling that onion won’t bring too many tears to your eyes.
